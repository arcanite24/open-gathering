# Open Gathering Implementation Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing Magic: The Gathering sets in the Open Gathering engine. The goal is to establish a solid foundation that enables systematic implementation of MTG sets while maintaining code quality, test coverage, and documentation standards.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a structured, phased approach:

1. **Foundation Setup**: Establish core frameworks and patterns
2. **Core Mechanics**: Implement essential MTG rules and mechanics
3. **Card Implementation**: Systematically implement cards by type
4. **Set Integration**: Assemble complete sets with proper testing
5. **Validation & Optimization**: Test, refine, and optimize implementations

This approach ensures we build a robust foundation before tackling complex card interactions.

## Card Type Implementation Framework

We'll implement cards by type, following this priority order:

### 1. Basic Lands
- Implement all basic land types (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest)
- Each produces one mana of corresponding color when tapped
- No additional abilities
- Serve as foundation for mana system

### 2. Creatures
- Implement core creature mechanics:
  - Power/Toughness
  - Combat (attacking, blocking)
  - Summoning sickness
  - Damage and death
- Support creature keywords:
  - Flying
  - Trample
  - First strike
  - Double strike
  - Deathtouch
  - Lifelink
  - Vigilance

### 3. Enchantments
- Implement static abilities that modify game state
- Support Auras (enchantments that attach to permanents)
- Handle enters-the-battlefield and leaves-the-battlefield triggers

### 4. Artifacts
- Implement artifact-specific mechanics
- Support artifact creatures
- Handle mana-producing artifacts

### 5. Instants & Sorceries
- Implement spell stack mechanics
- Support targeting system
- Handle spell resolution and effects

### 6. Planeswalkers
- Implement loyalty counters
- Support loyalty abilities
- Handle damage and removal

## Core Mechanics Implementation Roadmap

### 1. Turn Structure
- Complete turn phases and steps
- Implement priority system
- Handle phase transitions
- Support special actions during phases

### 2. Mana System
- Implement mana pool management
- Support mana payment for spells and abilities
- Handle mana burn (if applicable)
- Support mana abilities

### 3. Combat System
- Implement attack and block declarations
- Handle combat damage assignment
- Support first strike and double strike
- Implement trample damage
- Handle combat triggers

### 4. Stack & Timing
- Implement spell and ability stack
- Support spell copying
- Handle counterspells
- Implement split second (if applicable)

### 5. State-Based Actions
- Implement creature death from damage
- Handle zero toughness creatures
- Support legend rule
- Implement poison counters

### 6. Continuous Effects
- Implement effect layers
- Support temporary modifications
- Handle dependency between effects
- Support effect expiration

## Set Implementation Methodology

### 1. Data Organization
- Create dedicated JSON files for each set
- Organize by set code (e.g., `alpha.json`, `beta.json`)
- Include complete card data:
  - Name
  - Mana cost
  - Types
  - Oracle text
  - Power/Toughness (for creatures)
  - Abilities and effects

### 2. Implementation Process
For each card in a set:

1. **Analyze Oracle Text**: Break down card abilities and effects
2. **Identify Mechanics**: Determine required game mechanics
3. **Implement Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite mechanics exist
4. **Code Implementation**: Create ability/effect classes
5. **Register Implementation**: Add to ability registry
6. **Write Tests**: Create comprehensive unit tests
7. **Document**: Update implementation notes

### 3. Quality Assurance
- 100% test coverage for implemented cards
- Manual testing of card interactions
- Performance testing for complex scenarios
- Code review for all implementations

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing
- Test individual card abilities in isolation
- Verify correct game state changes
- Test edge cases and invalid actions
- Use mock game states for controlled testing

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test card interactions
- Verify proper event triggering
- Test complex game scenarios
- Validate turn and phase progression

### 3. Scenario Testing
- Create test scenarios for specific card combinations
- Test against known MTG interactions
- Validate timing and priority rules
- Test win/loss conditions

### 4. Performance Testing
- Measure game state update performance
- Test memory usage during extended games
- Validate serialization/deserialization
- Benchmark complex ability chains

## Documentation Standards

### 1. Code Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all classes and methods
- Clear parameter and return type documentation
- Examples for complex implementations
- Performance considerations

### 2. Implementation Notes
- Document design decisions for complex cards
- Note any MTG rule interpretations
- Track known limitations
- Record testing coverage

### 3. Set Documentation
- List all implemented cards
- Note any missing cards and reasons
- Document implementation status
- Track testing progress

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Branches**: Create branches for each set implementation
2. **Pull Requests**: Submit PRs for code review
3. **CI/CD**: Automated testing on every commit
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update docs with each implementation
5. **Release Process**: Tag releases for completed sets

## First Set Implementation: Alpha

The Alpha set will serve as our first complete implementation, focusing on:

- Core mechanics validation
- Card implementation patterns
- Testing framework refinement
- Documentation process

This set will be thoroughly tested and serve as a template for future set implementations.
