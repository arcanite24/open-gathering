# Alpha Set Validation and Testing Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive validation and testing strategy for the Alpha set implementation in the Open Gathering engine. The goal is to ensure all cards work correctly, interactions are properly handled, and the implementation meets quality standards.

## Validation Objectives

1. Verify 100% of Alpha set cards function correctly
2. Validate all card interactions and edge cases
3. Ensure compliance with MTG rules
4. Confirm performance meets requirements
5. Achieve high code quality and maintainability

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Testing
Test individual card abilities and effects in isolation.

#### Coverage Requirements
- 100% unit test coverage for all card implementations
- Test all methods and functions
- Test positive and negative cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions

#### Test Types
- **Ability Activation**: Can the ability be activated when appropriate?
- **Effect Resolution**: Does the effect resolve correctly?
- **Cost Payment**: Are costs properly validated and paid?
- **Target Validation**: Are targets properly validated?
- **State Changes**: Does the game state change correctly?

### 2. Integration Testing
Test card interactions and combinations.

#### Coverage Requirements
- 90% coverage for card type interactions
- Test all common interaction patterns
- Test timing and priority rules
- Test state-based actions

#### Test Matrix
| Source \ Target | Creature | Player | Land | Enchantment | Artifact | Instant | Sorcery |
|----------------|----------|--------|------|-------------|----------|---------|---------|

### 3. Scenario Testing
Test realistic game scenarios that involve multiple cards and mechanics.

#### Scenario Categories
- **Combat Scenarios**: Test various combat situations
- **Spell Interactions**: Test spell combinations
- **Resource Management**: Test mana and card economy
- **Win Conditions**: Test various ways to win
- **Edge Cases**: Test unusual game states

#### Example Scenarios
1. **First Strike Combat**
   - Setup: Two creatures, one with first strike
   - Actions: Attack and block
   - Expected: First strike creature deals damage first

2. **Counterspell Chain**
   - Setup: Player casts spell, opponent has Counterspell, first player has another Counterspell
   - Actions: Cast spell, opponent counters, first player counters the counter
   - Expected: Original spell resolves

3. **Life Gain/Loss Race**
   - Setup: Both players at 5 life, each has a spell that deals 3 damage and gains 2 life
   - Actions: Both cast spells
   - Expected: Final life totals depend on casting order

4. **Board Wipe Recovery**
   - Setup: Board full of creatures, player has "return all creatures from graveyard" spell
   - Actions: Cast board wipe, then recovery spell
   - Expected: Creatures return to battlefield

### 4. Performance Testing
Test the engine's performance with the Alpha set.

#### Test Categories
- **Large Game States**: Test with 50+ permanents on battlefield
- **Complex Ability Chains**: Test long chains of triggered abilities
- **High Card Draw**: Test effects that draw many cards
- **Mass Removal**: Test board wipes with many permanents
- **Infinite Loops**: Test detection and handling of potential infinite loops

#### Performance Metrics
- **Execution Time**: Measure time to resolve complex actions
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during extended games
- **Frame Rate**: For UI integration, measure UI responsiveness
- **Garbage Collection**: Monitor GC frequency and impact

#### Performance Benchmarks
| Test | Target | Maximum |
|------|--------|---------|
| Cast Lightning Bolt | < 10ms | < 50ms |
| Resolve Ancestral Recall | < 20ms | < 100ms |
| Board Wipe (10 creatures) | < 50ms | < 200ms |
| Complex Ability Chain | < 100ms | < 500ms |
| Memory Growth per Turn | < 1MB | < 5MB |

## Validation Methodology

### 1. Automated Testing
Use Jest for comprehensive automated testing.

#### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── abilities/
│   └── effects/
├── integration/
│   ├── card_interactions/
│   └── phase_transitions/
├── scenarios/
└── performance/
```

#### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:scenarios
npm run test:performance

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### 2. Manual Testing
For scenarios that can't be automated.

#### Testing Protocol
1. **Test Case Definition**: Clearly define the test scenario
2. **Setup Instructions**: Step-by-step setup
3. **Execution Steps**: Actions to perform
4. **Expected Results**: What should happen
5. **Result Recording**: Document actual results

#### Test Environment
- Use the CLI interface for manual testing
- Start with predefined scenarios when possible
- Document all actions and results
- Report any inconsistencies or bugs
