# Alpha Set Implementation Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing the Alpha set in the Open Gathering engine. The Alpha set will serve as our first complete MTG set implementation, validating our frameworks and establishing a template for future sets.

## Risk Assessment

### 1. Technical Risks
- **Incomplete Core Mechanics**: Some core mechanics may not be fully implemented
  - *Mitigation*: Spike solutions for complex mechanics
  - *Contingency*: Prioritize essential mechanics first

- **Performance Issues**: Complex card interactions may cause performance problems
  - *Mitigation*: Early performance testing
  - *Contingency*: Optimize critical paths

- **Memory Leaks**: Long-running games may expose memory issues
  - *Mitigation*: Memory monitoring from early stages
  - *Contingency*: Implement garbage collection strategies

### 2. Scope Risks
- **Underestimation**: Complexity of cards may be underestimated
  - *Mitigation*: Detailed complexity assessment before implementation
  - *Contingency*: Adjust scope by deferring non-essential cards

- **Feature Creep**: New requirements may emerge during implementation
  - *Mitigation*: Strict scope control
  - *Contingency*: Log new requirements for future sets

### 3. Quality Risks
- **Bugs in Core Mechanics**: Errors in fundamental systems
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing of core systems
  - *Contingency*: Dedicated bug fixing period

- **Inconsistent Implementations**: Variations in implementation quality
  - *Mitigation*: Code reviews and style guides
  - *Contingency*: Refactoring pass before release

### 4. Schedule Risks
- **Delays**: Implementation may take longer than expected
  - *Mitigation*: Realistic time estimates with buffer
  - *Contingency*: Extend timeline or reduce scope

- **Resource Constraints**: Team availability may be limited
  - *Mitigation*: Cross-training team members
  - *Contingency*: Adjust workload distribution

- **Edge Cases**: Does it handle unusual situations correctly?
- **Interactions**: Does it work with other card types?
- **Timing**: Does it work at different game moments?
- **Resource Limits**: Does it work with limited resources?

### 3. Acceptance Testing
Before marking a card as complete, it must pass:
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Performance check

## Documentation Requirements

### 1. Code Documentation
All implementations must have:
- JSDoc comments for classes and methods
- Implementation notes for complex cards
- References to MTG rules
- Performance characteristics

### 2. Set Documentation
Complete documentation for the Alpha set:
- Implementation overview
- Card list with status
- Known issues
- Usage guide
- Performance characteristics

### 3. Process Documentation
Document the implementation process:
- Lessons learned
- Best practices
- Common patterns
- Troubleshooting guide

## Contingency Planning

### 1. Scope Reduction
If behind schedule, reduce scope by:
- Deferring complex edge cases
- Implementing simplified versions of complex cards
- Focusing on core functionality first

### 2. Timeline Extension
If necessary, extend the timeline by:
- Adding buffer time
- Reducing other project commitments
- Adding temporary resources

### 3. Quality Trade-offs
If critical path is blocked:
- Implement core functionality first
- Add simplified versions of complex mechanics
- Address edge cases in subsequent updates

## Success Metrics

The Alpha set implementation is successful when:
- [ ] 100% of cards are implemented
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Code quality standards are met
- [ ] Team knowledge is transferred
- [ ] Process is documented

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for successfully implementing the Alpha set. By following this plan, we ensure a high-quality, complete implementation that validates our engine and establishes a foundation for future set implementations.
